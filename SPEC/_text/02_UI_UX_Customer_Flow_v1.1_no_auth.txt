2. Onboarding Wizard (Core Story)
The onboarding experience must be a 4-step checklist with clear success states and zero ambiguity.
Step 1 — Connect Resend
UI: API key password input + 'Test connection' button + 'Save'
Success state: shows 'Connected' and displays workspace metadata (e.g., domains count)
Error states: invalid key, network error, permission insufficient
Step 2 — Choose Mode
Test Mode (no sending domain required): send only to resend.dev test inboxes and labeled variants
Production Mode (domain required): shows domain verification instructions (not required for class demo)
Step 3 — Webhooks (Optional in MVP)
Default: Not required. App can poll email status using Resend 'retrieve email' endpoint.
If enabled: show webhook URL and instructions; show 'last webhook received' heartbeat.
Advanced: implement signature verification and store webhook secret.
Step 4 — Send a Test
UI: 'Create Test List' button (auto-creates a contact list with delivered/bounced/complained/suppressed test inboxes)
UI: 'Send Test Broadcast' button (sends a simple template)
UI: Live timeline: queued -> sent -> delivered/bounced/failed
3. Screens (Detailed)
3.1 Home Dashboard
Cards: Sends, Delivered, Bounced, Suppressed, Synthetic Clicks, CTR uplift vs baseline
Chart: daily sends/clicks (last 7 days)
Autopilot status: which ML modules are ON
3.2 Contacts
Import CSV, add single contact, tag contacts
Show columns: email, status (active/suppressed), timezone, risk score, last event, segments count
3.3 Segments
Rule builder (simple): filters on tags, status, timezone, last_seen, last_click
Segment detail: size, CTR, best send-window heatmap, recommended next action
3.4 Flows
Flow templates: Onboarding (3 steps), Activation nudge, Re-engage 7d, Winback 30d
Each step: trigger event, delay, segment filter, template, ML toggles (send-time, hygiene, experiment)
3.5 Broadcasts
Pick segment, pick template, optional subject variants A/B
Schedule: send now OR autopilot recommended time
3.6 Deliverability
Bounce rate (hard/soft), suppressed count, domain breakdown (optional)
Action list: 'suppress risky', 'throttle cold segment', 'remove repeated hard bounces'
4. Template Library
Ship a minimal template library with variables; avoid WYSIWYG editor in MVP.

Copilot: Build the onboarding wizard UI
Copilot Prompt (paste as-is):
Create a Next.js page '/onboarding' that shows a 4-step checklist:
1) Connect Resend (API key input + test)
2) Choose mode (Test Mode vs Production Mode)
3) Webhooks (optional) with a webhook URL + last event heartbeat
4) Send a Test (Create Test List, Send Test Broadcast, show timeline).
Use clean card UI, clear success/error states, and store progress in the database (single demo workspace; no sign-in).
Assume API routes exist: /api/integrations/resend/test, /api/integrations/resend/save, /api/test/create-list, /api/test/send-broadcast.
